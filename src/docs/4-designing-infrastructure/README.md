# Designing Infrastructure

Define practices that enable the generation of scalable and maintainable code over time.

## Core practice: Small, Simple pieces

This chapter draws on design principles for modularity learned from decades of software design considering them from the point of viw of code-driven infrastructure. It then looks at different types of components in an infrastructure system, with an eye to how we can leverage them for better modularity.

## Building Stacks from Components

This chapter focuses on modularizing infrastructure stacks; that is, breaking stacks into smaller pieces of code.

## Using Stacks as Components

This chapter explores different approaches from a viewpoint of how the infrastructure its been defined affects on coupling.
