# Working with Infrastructure Stacks

Defines the terminology used in IaC and patterns used to deploy and test the builded infrastructure

## Building Infrastructure Stacks as Code

This chapter describes patterns for grouping infrastructure resources in stacks

## Building Environment with Stacks

The last chapter described an infrastructure stack as a collection of infrastructure resources that you manage as a single unit. An environment is also a collection of infrastructure resources. So is a stack the same thing as an environment? This chapter explains that maybe it is, but maybe it isn't.

## Configuring Stack Instances

In this chapter it describes ways on which you can send configuration to a concrete stack. This configuration helps you to instance the infrastructure with a sets of settings that let you handle different use cases (for example, a production and a development environment). 

## Core practice: Continuously and Deliver

This chapter focuses on fundamental challenges and approaches for testing infrastructure

## Testing Infrastructure Stacks

This chapter builds on the latter one with specific guidances on testing infrastructure stack code.
