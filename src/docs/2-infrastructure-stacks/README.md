# Working with Infrastructure Stacks

Defines the terminology used in IaC and patterns used to deploy and test the builded infrastructure.

## Chapters
1. [Building Infrastructure Stacks as Code](./chapters/): The concept of infrastructure stack will be described and which is the best way to manage it.
2. [Building Environment with Stacks](./chapters/): The last chapter described an infrastructure stack as a collection of infrastructure resources that you manage as a single unit. An environment is also a collection of infrastructure resources. So is a stack the same thing as an environment? This chapter explains that maybe it is, but maybe it isn't.
3. [Configuring Stack Instances](./chapters/): In this chapter it describes ways on which you can send configuration to a concrete stack. This configuration helps you to instance the infrastructure with a sets of settings that let you handle different use cases (for example, a production and a development environment). 
4. [Core practice: Continuously and Deliver](./chapters/): This chapter focuses on fundamental challenges and approaches for testing infrastructure
5. [Testing Infrastructure Stacks](./chapters/): This chapter builds on the latter one with specific guidances on testing infrastructure stack code.
