# Building Infrastructure Stacks as Code

This chapter describes patterns for grouping infrastructure resources in stacks.

## What Is an Infrastructure Stack?

__An infrastructure stack is a collection of infrastructure resources that you define, provision, and update as unit__. 

You write source code to define the elements of a stack, which are resources and services that your infrastructure platform provides. For example, your stack may include a virtual machine, database and a subnet (all of these components are primitive resources [which are been seen here](../../1-foundation/chapters/3-infrastructure-as-platform.md#primitive-resources)).

We could summarize this concept as follows:

</p>

When you run the stack management tool, which reads your stack source code and uses the cloud platform's API to assemble the elements defined in the code to __provision an instance of your stack__.

Examples of stack management tools include:
- [HashiCorp Terraform](https://www.hashicorp.com/es/products/terraform)
- [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/es/cloudformation/)
- [Azure Resource Manager](https://azure.microsoft.com/es-es/get-started/azure-portal/resource-manager)
- [Google Infrastructure Manager](https://cloud.google.com/infrastructure-manager/docs)
- [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/)
