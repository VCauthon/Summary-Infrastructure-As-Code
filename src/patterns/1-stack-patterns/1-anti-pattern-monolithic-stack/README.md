# Monolithic Patter

This section shows an example of how infrastructure code should be organized to create the Monolithic Stack anti-pattern.

> This [section](../../../docs/2-infrastructure-stacks/chapters/1-building-infrastructure-stacks-as-code.md#anti-patterns-monolithic-stack) describes this pattern.

In the monolithic pattern, all resources are grouped into the same stack, which means we will have everything just as it is defined in the base infrastructure.
