# WebApp URL

This is a simple web page that uses DynamoDB to display a list of web pages alongside a counter that indicates the number of times each web page has been selected.

This docker image is public at [docker.io/joeyratt/webapp-aws](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/joeyratt/webapp-aws/general).

> TODO: This webapp does not follow best practices as it does not even have a test.
