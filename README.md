# Summary-Infrastructure-As-Code

The purpose of this summary is to explore how cloud and automation technologies can be leveraged to make changes easily, safely, quickly, and responsibly through Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

Since the benefits of IaC don’t come automatically from cloud or automation tools, this summary focuses on best practices and demonstrates how to apply them through practical examples.

# TODO: ⚠️ Check if there are pending TODOs in the documentation
